Tic-Tac-Toe Game Application
This repository hosts a simple yet versatile Tic-Tac-Toe game application. It's built to provide an enjoyable gaming experience while serving as a demonstration of basic programming concepts.

 Issues:
User Interface (UI): The UI is intentionally kept simple; however, improvements can be made to enhance the user experience.

Player Options: Currently, the game requires two human players. However, in future iterations, the option to choose between one or two players will be added.

Future Enhancements
In upcoming updates, the following enhancements are planned:

One Player Mode: Introduce the option for solo play against the computer. This will involve implementing an AI algorithm to act as the second player, providing a challenging single-player experience.

Score Calculation: Enhance the two-player mode to include score tracking, providing competitive gameplay.
